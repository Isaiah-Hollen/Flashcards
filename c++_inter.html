            { front: "What is encapsulation?", back: "Bundling data and methods that operate on that data." },
            { front: "What is inheritance?", back: "The ability of a class to inherit properties from another class." },

            { front: "What is the difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism?", back: "Compile-time uses function overloading; run-time uses virtual functions." },
            { front: "What is a virtual function?", back: "A function that can be overridden in derived classes for run-time polymorphism." },
            { front: "What does the 'this' pointer represent?", back: "Pointer to the current object." },
            { front: "What is a reference variable?", back: "An alias for another variable, declared with '&'." },
            { front: "What is a copy constructor?", back: "Constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object." },
            { front: "What is an initializer list?", back: "Syntax to initialize class members in a constructor." },
            { front: "What is an abstract class?", back: "A class with at least one pure virtual function." },
            { front: "What is a pure virtual function?", back: "A virtual function set to 0, requiring override in derived classes." },
            { front: "What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?", back: "Shallow copy copies pointers; deep copy duplicates actual data." },
            { front: "What is dynamic memory allocation?", back: "Allocating memory at runtime using new/delete." },
            { front: "What is the difference between stack and heap memory?", back: "Stack is for static memory; heap is for dynamic memory." },
            { front: "What is the use of the 'new' keyword?", back: "Allocates memory dynamically and calls a constructor." },
            { front: "What is the 'delete' keyword used for?", back: "Frees memory allocated by new and calls the destructor." },
            { front: "What is a static member in a class?", back: "Shared among all objects of the class." },
            { front: "What is a friend function?", back: "A function that can access private and protected members of a class." },

            { front: "What is a namespace?", back: "A declarative region to avoid name conflicts." },
            { front: "What is the difference between '==' and '='?", back: "'=' assigns a value; '==' compares values." },
            { front: "What is the 'const' keyword used for?", back: "Declares a variable or function argument as read-only." },
            { front: "What is the difference between const int* and int* const?", back: "Pointer to const vs const pointer to int." },

            { front: "What is a function template?", back: "Defines a generic function that works with different types." },
            { front: "What is a class template?", back: "Defines a generic class that works with different types." },
            { front: "What is the 'typedef' keyword used for?", back: "Creates an alias for another data type." },
            { front: "What is the difference between typedef and using?", back: "'using' is more modern and supports templates." },

            { front: "What is pointer arithmetic?", back: "Operations like increment, decrement on pointer addresses." },
            { front: "What is a dangling pointer?", back: "A pointer pointing to memory that has been deleted." },
            { front: "What is the purpose of 'const' in function arguments?", back: "Prevents the function from modifying the argument." },
