        [
            { front:"What is a metaclass in Python?", back:"A class of a class; it controls the creation of classes." },
            { front:"What does the 'super()' function do?", back:"It calls a method from a parent class." },
            { front:"What is the MRO (Method Resolution Order)?", back:"The order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy." },

            { front:"What is a descriptor in Python?", back:"An object that defines __get__, __set__, and __delete__." },
            { front:"What is the difference between classmethod and staticmethod?", back:"classmethod takes cls; staticmethod takes neither cls nor self." },
            { front:"What is duck typing?", back:"Type is determined by behavior rather than inheritance." },
            { front:"What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?", back:"__str__ is for users; __repr__ is for developers/debugging." },
            { front:"How do you implement a context manager?", back:"Use __enter__ and __exit__ methods or @contextmanager." },
            { front:"What is the 'with' statement used for?", back:"It simplifies resource management using context managers." },
            { front:"What is a coroutine in Python?", back:"A function that can pause and resume its execution (async/await)." },

            { front:"What is the GIL?", back:"Global Interpreter Lock: only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time." },
            { front:"How do you achieve true parallelism in Python?", back:"Using multiprocessing instead of threading." },
            { front:"What are Python slots?", back:"__slots__ restricts dynamic attribute creation and saves memory." },
            { front:"What is monkey patching?", back:"Dynamically changing classes or modules at runtime." },
            { front:"What is memoization in functools?", back:"Caching function calls using @lru_cache." },
            { front:"How do you create an abstract base class?", back:"Use abc.ABC and @abstractmethod." },
            { front:"What is the purpose of the 'yield from' statement?", back:"Delegates part of a generator to another generator." },
            { front:"What are Python type hints?", back:"They define expected argument and return types in functions." },
            { front:"How do you declare a Union type hint?", back:"Union[int, str] or int | str (Python 3.10+)" },
            { front:"What does the walrus operator ':=' do?", back:"Assigns a value to a variable as part of an expression." },
            { front:"What is pattern matching (Python 3.10+)?", back:"A switch-case like structure using match-case blocks." },
            { front:"How do you serialize objects in Python?", back:"Using the pickle or json module." },
            { front:"What is the difference between pickle and json?", back:"Pickle handles Python objects; JSON is human-readable and portable." },
            { front:"What are dunder methods?", back:"Special methods like __init__, __str__, etc." },
            { front:"How can you dynamically import a module?", back:"Using importlib.import_module()" },
            { front:"How do you inspect objects at runtime?", back:"Use the inspect module." },
            { front:"What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?", back:"Shallow copies references; deep copies all objects recursively." },
            { front:"How do you deep copy an object?", back:"Use copy.deepcopy()" },
            { front:"What is a weak reference?", back:"A reference that doesnâ€™t increase the reference count." },
            { front:"How does Python manage memory?", back:"Using reference counting and garbage collection." },
            { front:"What is an iterator protocol?", back:"Object with __iter__() and __next__() methods." },
            { front:"What is the difference between iterable and iterator?", back:"Iterator has __next__; iterable can return an iterator." },
            { front:"What is a frozen set?", back:"An immutable version of a set." },
            { front:"What does the @dataclass decorator do?", back:"Automatically generates __init__, __repr__, and __eq__ for classes." },

            { front:"What is eval() and why is it dangerous?", back:"Evaluates a string as Python code; risky due to arbitrary code execution." },
            { front:"How do you prevent circular imports?", back:"Use local imports or restructure your modules." },
            { front:"What does sys.argv contain?", back:"Command-line arguments passed to a script." },
            { front:"What is the use of __init__.py?", back:"Marks a directory as a Python package." },

            { front:"What is a proxy object?", back:"An object that delegates operations to another object." }
