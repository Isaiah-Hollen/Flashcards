        [
            { front: "What is the Rule of Five in C++?", back: "If a class requires a user-defined destructor, copy/move constructor, or copy/move assignment, it likely needs all five." },
            { front: "What is placement new in C++?", back: "A way to construct an object in a pre-allocated memory buffer." },
            { front: "What does the 'explicit' keyword do in constructors?", back: "Prevents implicit conversions." },
            { front: "What is SFINAE in C++?", back: "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error – a feature of template metaprogramming." },
            { front: "What is the difference between 'override' and 'final' in C++11?", back: "'override' ensures a method overrides a base class method; 'final' prevents further overriding." },
            { front: "What are rvalue references used for?", back: "To implement move semantics and perfect forwarding." },
            { front: "How does move semantics improve performance?", back: "Avoids deep copying by transferring ownership of resources." },
            { front: "What is a virtual destructor?", back: "Ensures the derived class destructor is called when deleting via a base pointer." },
            { front: "What is the purpose of std::unique_ptr?", back: "Smart pointer that ensures sole ownership of a dynamically allocated object." },
            { front: "What is the purpose of std::shared_ptr?", back: "Smart pointer that allows multiple shared ownerships of an object." },
            { front: "How does std::weak_ptr prevent circular references?", back: "It observes shared_ptr without increasing reference count." },
            { front: "What is the use of noexcept in functions?", back: "Declares a function does not throw exceptions; improves optimizations." },
            { front: "What is a lambda expression in C++?", back: "An anonymous function object used for inline functions." },
            { front: "What is a variadic template?", back: "A template that can take an arbitrary number of template arguments." },
            { front: "What is the use of std::enable_if?", back: "Used in template metaprogramming to enable/disable functions based on conditions." },
            { front: "What are template specializations?", back: "Custom implementation of a template for a specific type." },
            { front: "What is a constexpr function?", back: "A function that can be evaluated at compile-time." },
            { front: "What is the difference between static_cast and dynamic_cast?", back: "static_cast is compile-time; dynamic_cast is runtime with RTTI." },
            { front: "What is RAII?", back: "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization – managing resources via object lifetimes." },
            { front: "What is std::function?", back: "A general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper." },
            { front: "What is a functor in C++?", back: "A class that overloads the operator() to act like a function." },
            { front: "What is type erasure?", back: "A technique to hide specific types behind a generic interface." },
            { front: "What is the difference between 'inline' and 'constexpr'?", back: "'inline' suggests compiler to expand in place; 'constexpr' ensures compile-time evaluation." },
            { front: "What is the One Definition Rule (ODR)?", back: "States that entities should have a single definition across translation units." },
            { front: "What is a virtual table (vtable)?", back: "A mechanism for dynamic dispatch of virtual functions." },
            { front: "What is the diamond problem in multiple inheritance?", back: "Ambiguity caused by inheriting from a common base class twice." },
            { front: "How is the diamond problem solved in C++?", back: "Using virtual inheritance." },
            { front: "What is the difference between function overloading and overriding?", back: "Overloading changes signatures; overriding changes behavior in derived classes." },
            { front: "What is std::move used for?", back: "Casts an object to an rvalue to allow moving." },
            { front: "What is std::forward used for?", back: "Preserves the value category (lvalue/rvalue) in template functions." },

            { front: "What is std::variant?", back: "A type-safe union holding one of several types." },
            { front: "What is an abstract class?", back: "A class with at least one pure virtual function." },
            { front: "What is a pure virtual function?", back: "A function declared with = 0 that must be overridden by derived classes." },
            { front: "What is memory alignment and padding?", back: "Alignment is memory placement; padding fills gaps between members for alignment." },
            { front: "What is std::mutex used for?", back: "Provides mutual exclusion in multithreaded code." },
            { front: "What is a deadlock?", back: "A situation where two or more threads wait forever for resources held by each other." },
            { front: "What is std::thread?", back: "A C++11 class for creating and managing threads." },
            { front: "What is the difference between stack and heap allocation?", back: "Stack is automatic and fast; heap is dynamic and requires manual management." },
            { front: "What is alignment specifier alignas?", back: "Specifies alignment requirements for variables or types." },
            { front: "What is std::atomic?", back: "Provides atomic operations on variables to prevent data races." },
            { front: "What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?", back: "Deep copy duplicates resources; shallow copy copies pointers to same resources." },
            { front: "What is a memory leak?", back: "When dynamically allocated memory is not freed properly." },
            { front: "What is the difference between const int* and int* const?", back: "const int* is a pointer to constant int; int* const is a constant pointer to int." },

            { front: "What is the difference between 'new' and 'malloc'?", back: "'new' constructs objects and throws exceptions; 'malloc' allocates memory and returns NULL on failure." },
