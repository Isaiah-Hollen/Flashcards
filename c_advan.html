        const flashcards = 
        [
            { front: "What is the difference between setjmp() and longjmp()?", back: "setjmp() saves the calling environment for later use by longjmp() to perform a non-local jump." },

            { front: "Explain function-like macros and pitfalls.", back: "They act like functions but donâ€™t do type checking and can have side effects." },
            { front: "What is the significance of _Generic in C11?", back: "It allows type-generic macros for selecting expressions based on type." },
            { front: "What are variadic functions and how are they implemented?", back: "Functions with variable arguments using stdarg.h macros like va_start, va_arg, va_end." },
            { front: "How do you declare and use inline assembly in C?", back: "Using 'asm' or '__asm__' keyword, often GCC-specific syntax." },
            { front: "What is the impact of strict aliasing rule?", back: "It can lead to incorrect optimizations if violated; affects pointer-based code." },
            { front: "What is pointer aliasing?", back: "When two or more pointers access the same memory, potentially leading to conflicts." },
            { front: "What is the role of volatile with memory-mapped I/O?", back: "It ensures each access goes to hardware and prevents optimization caching." },
            { front: "What is the difference between _exit() and exit()?", back: "_exit() terminates immediately without flushing stdio buffers, exit() performs cleanup." },
            { front: "How do you create a shared library in C?", back: "Compile with -fPIC and link with -shared; load using dlopen()." },
            { front: "What is the purpose of dlopen and dlsym?", back: "They allow dynamic loading of shared libraries at runtime." },
            { front: "How are threads handled in C?", back: "Using POSIX threads (pthreads): pthread_create(), pthread_join(), etc." },
            { front: "What is a race condition?", back: "A flaw where the output depends on the sequence/timing of threads or processes." },
            { front: "What is false sharing in multithreading?", back: "Multiple threads modify variables that share the same cache line, hurting performance." },
            { front: "How can you prevent deadlocks?", back: "By acquiring locks in a consistent order and avoiding circular wait conditions." },
            { front: "What is a weak symbol in C?", back: "A symbol that can be overridden by another during linking." },
            { front: "What is placement new in C?", back: "C does not support 'new', but placement new exists in C++ only." },
            { front: "What is memory sanitization?", back: "Tools like valgrind or AddressSanitizer help detect memory misuse and leaks." },
            { front: "How do you align a struct on a 64-byte boundary?", back: "Use compiler-specific attributes like __attribute__((aligned(64)))." },
            { front: "What are memory barriers?", back: "Instructions that enforce ordering constraints on memory operations in concurrent code." },
            { front: "How does the C preprocessor work?", back: "It handles macro expansion, file inclusion, and conditional compilation before compiling." },
            { front: "What is loop unrolling?", back: "An optimization technique that reduces loop overhead and increases performance." },
            { front: "What is tail call optimization?", back: "Compiler optimization that reuses the current function's stack frame for a final call." },
            { front: "What are intrusive data structures?", back: "Data structures where nodes themselves store pointers for linkage (e.g., Linux kernel lists)." },
            { front: "What is the use of offsetof()?", back: "Gives the byte offset of a struct member from the start of the struct." },
            { front: "What is packed struct?", back: "A struct with no padding between members; declared with __attribute__((packed))." },
            { front: "What is a segmentation fault?", back: "Accessing memory not allocated or allowed, causing abnormal termination." },
            { front: "What are the dangers of casting pointers?", back: "Incorrect casting can lead to misaligned access and undefined behavior." },
            { front: "What is type punning?", back: "Accessing a data object as a different type, which can violate strict aliasing rules." },
            { front: "How do you ensure atomic access in C?", back: "Use atomic builtins like __sync_fetch_and_add or stdatomic.h (C11)." },
            { front: "What are signal-safe functions?", back: "Functions safe to call from within a signal handler, like write(), _exit()." },
            { front: "What is errno in C?", back: "A macro expanding to a global int storing error codes from library calls." },
            { front: "What is the difference between fork and exec?", back: "fork() creates a copy of the process; exec() replaces current process with a new program." },
            { front: "What is IPC in C?", back: "Inter-process communication: shared memory, message queues, pipes, and semaphores." },
            { front: "What is a memory fence?", back: "A CPU instruction that prevents certain kinds of reordering for memory operations." },
            { front: "How do you implement thread synchronization?", back: "Using mutexes, condition variables, spinlocks, and semaphores." },
            { front: "What is a thunk in C?", back: "A piece of code to adapt calling conventions or insert hooks at runtime." },
            { front: "What is link-time optimization (LTO)?", back: "Optimization across translation units at the linking stage for better performance." },
            { front: "How do you use memory pools in C?", back: "Pre-allocate blocks of memory and manage allocations from this pool manually." },
            { front: "What is the difference between static and dynamic linking?", back: "Static links code at compile time; dynamic links at runtime via shared libraries." },
            { front: "What are compiler builtins?", back: "Special functions provided by the compiler like __builtin_popcount or __builtin_expect." },
            { front: "What is a trampoline function?", back: "A function dynamically created to redirect calls, often used in closures or debugging." },
